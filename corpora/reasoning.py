"""
Bring in reasoning traces, in the markers this model already uses.

OpenThoughts-114k is DeepSeek-R1 deliberating on maths, code and science: a
long chain of thought and then an answer. The shape is already in the corpus -
the arithmetic data writes its working between think markers - so these
reinforce a format the model is learning rather than introducing a new one.
The source wraps its sections in <|begin_of_thought|> and
<|begin_of_solution|>; those become <think> and the answer body, which are
single symbols in this alphabet rather than spellings.

Length is not filtered. A trace longer than the window is read across several
windows: every chunk still trains, and only the ability to attend back to the
problem while writing the answer is lost, which for a deliberation that is
mostly locally structured costs little.

    python3 -m corpora reasoning --limit 2000     # try it small first
    python3 -m corpora reasoning                  # all of it

Writes one file per trace, sharded into subdirectories - a hundred thousand
files in one directory is slow to walk and unpleasant to look at.
